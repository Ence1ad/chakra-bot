## Introduction

### Overview
The **tracker-tgbot** offers an array of features that empower users to efficiently organize their tasks, track their time, and analyze their productivity. Whether you're working individually or within a group, this bot streamlines your workflow and enhances your control over activities.

## Key Features  

- **Categories and Actions:** Easily create, delete, update, and display categories and actions right from your Telegram chat.

- **Trackers:** Initiate, view duration, stop, or delete trackers for specific activities within chosen categories.

- **Reports:** Generate comprehensive weekly reports, exported as Excel spreadsheets with embedded graphs for data visualization.

- **Monitoring and Metrics**: This project incorporates monitoring tools to help you gain insights into the performance and health of various components. The primary monitoring stack includes Prometheus, Grafana, PostgreSQL Exporter, Redis Exporter, and Alertmanager. These tools offer several advantages, such as real-time metrics, alerting, and visualization, to ensure your application is running smoothly.

- **Docker Management**: This project includes Portainer, a powerful open-source Docker management tool that simplifies container management, deployment, and monitoring.

## How It Works

**Joining a Group:**
When you're added to a specific Telegram group, the bot automatically registers you in both a PostgreSQL and Redis database.

**Private Chat:**
In a private chat with the bot, simply use the `/start` command to initiate the interaction. The bot responds by presenting a menu with five inline buttons: Categories, Actions, Reports, Trackers, and Exit.

**Categories and Actions:**
- Categories: Manage up to 10 categories with options for creation, deletion, updating, and viewing.
- Actions: Create and manage activities, each associated with a category.

**Trackers:**
- Initiate: Start tracking time for a selected activity within a category.
- View Duration: Check the duration of ongoing activities.
- Stop: Stop tracking an activity, calculate its duration, and store the data.

**Reports:**
- Users can generate and download weekly reports containing all their tracked activities. Also At  the end of the week, the bot automatically generates a report based on the users' trackers saved for the week. Reports are exported as Excel spreadsheets.  
- Data Visualization: Analyze your tracked data through embedded graphs within the report.

**Language Selection**: 
- Users can change the language of the application simply use `/settings` command. The application currently supports two  languages (English and Russian). 

**Bot manual**
- If you need a full manual on how the bot works, you can always use the help command.

With **tracker-tgbot**, stay organized, boost productivity, and gain valuable insights into your daily activitiesâ€”all within your Telegram chat. Start using it today!
