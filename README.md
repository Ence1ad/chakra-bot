## Introduction

### Overview

## Key Features

- **Monitoring and Metrics**: This project incorporates monitoring tools to help you gain insights into the performance and health of various components. The primary monitoring stack includes Prometheus, Grafana, PostgreSQL Exporter, Redis Exporter, and Alertmanager. These tools offer several advantages, such as real-time metrics, alerting, and visualization, to ensure your application is running smoothly.

- **Docker Management**: This project includes Portainer, a powerful open-source Docker management tool that simplifies container management, deployment, and monitoring.

## How It Works

**Joining a Group:**
When you're added to a specific Telegram group, the bot automatically registers you in both a PostgreSQL and Redis database.

**Private Chat:**
In a private chat with the bot, simply use the `/start` command to initiate the interaction. The bot responds by presenting a menu with five inline buttons: Categories, Actions, Reports, Trackers, and Exit.

**Language Selection**: 
- Users can change the language of the application simply use `/settings` command. The application currently supports two  languages (English and Russian). 

**Bot manual**
- If you need a full manual on how the bot works, you can always use the `/help` command.
